/**
 * The top of every course in the series: the accent rule (drawn by brand.css
 * on body), the series row, the course title, its tagline, and whatever
 * navigation the course passes in.
 *
 * The wordmark sits above the title rather than in front of it, because the
 * series name is an imprint and not a prefix: the courses are "Neural Networks"
 * and "Transformers", published under one name, so a sibling reads the same two
 * lines with only the heading changed. The heading is the subject alone, and needs no
 * hidden prefix: the wordmark immediately above it is text, so a screen reader
 * reaches the series name first and then the course.
 *
 * `compact` marks an inner page, and on a phone it drops the tagline and sizes
 * the title down. The tagline is the course's pitch, which is what the front
 * door is for; on page seven of a course the reader has bought it already, and
 * on a 390px screen it costs four lines, a fifth of the first screenful. The
 * flag changes nothing above 560px, where the masthead costs nothing.
